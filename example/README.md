This is an example from

D. Sears and K. Rudie,
"On computing indistinguishable states of nondeterministic finite automata with partially observable transitions,"
*53rd IEEE Conference on Decision and Control*,
2014, pp. 6731-6736, doi: [10.1109/CDC.2014.7040446](https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2014.7040446).
